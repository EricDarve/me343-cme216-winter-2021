The next question refers to video "4.6 AD for Implicit Solvers" and "4.7 Conclusion."

Assume that we have computed a solution $$(x_0,y_0)$$ of this equation:

$$ x^2 + \frac{y^2}{2} + \exp(x) = 3 $$ 

1. Calculate $$dy/dx$$ at $$x=x_0$$ using implicit differentiation. Give your result in terms of $$(x_0,y_0)$$.
1. Describe briefly an example problem that would require physics-constrained learning.
