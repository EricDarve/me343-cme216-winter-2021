Write your answers in a PDF and upload the document on [gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/102338) for submission.

Each question is worth 10 points. The due date is given on [gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/102338). Post on [Slack](https://stanford.enterprise.slack.com/) for questions.

Late day policy: 1 late day with a 20% grade penalty.

The next questions refer to slide deck "3.3 TensorFlow loss functions".

1. Assume you use the `CategoricalCrossentropy` loss function in TF. What constraints do you need to impose on the output $$\hat{y}$$ of the DNN so that the loss function is valid and meaningful?
1. Consider the hinge loss function and assume that $$y = 1$$ for some input $$x$$. Plot the loss function as a function of $$\hat{y}$$ the output of the DNN. Assume that $$-\infty < \hat{y} < \infty$$.
