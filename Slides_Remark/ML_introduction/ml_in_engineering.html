## Machine learning in computational engineering

Computational engineering has unique requirements, which are different from image and signal processing, or computer
vision.

---

**Regression** is a much more common application than classification.

In most cases, we are interested in computing a pressure, velocity, or strain field.

The required **accuracy** is typically high.

For example, we often expect errors in the range $10^{-4}$&ndash;$10^{-3}$ or less to have confidence in the prediction.

Data is more limited

---
class: middle

Data in computational engineering is typically obtained either through

- experiments, which may be expensive and typically do not generate large amounts of data, or
- high-fidelity computer simulations.

The advent of automated sensors and large-scale parallel computers is changing this landscape.

We are often interested in quantifying the **uncertainty** in the prediction and deriving intervals of confidence for
our prediction.

---
class: center, middle

We can **leverage equations from physics,** conservation laws, physical principles, which can inform our learning
algorithms.

This is different from other applications in computer science for example where most of the learning is
restricted to learning from data.
