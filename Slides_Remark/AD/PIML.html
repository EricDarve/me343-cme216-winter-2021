# Physics-informed machine learning

Physics-informed learning leverages:

- Data from experiments and/or high-fidelity computer simulations
- Physics knowledge in the form of constraints

# Examples of constraints

Equality:

$$F = m a$$

$$ \rho(t) = \rho(0) $$

$$ E(t) = E(0) $$

Differential equations:

$$ - \nabla ( k \cdot \nabla u ) = f $$

$$ \nabla \times E = - \frac{\partial B}{\partial t} $$

---
class: middle

$$ - \nabla ( k \cdot \nabla u ) = f $$

Assume we are given $k$ and $f$ and want to compute $u$.

We may be given some data: $\\{ u(x_i) \\}_i$.

 Conventional ML: DNN model $u(x; \theta)$

$$ \text{Loss} = \sum\_{i=1}^{n\_\text{obs}} \Vert u(x_i; \theta) - u_i \Vert_2^2 $$

How can we leverage our PDE?

$$ - \nabla ( k \cdot \nabla u ) = f $$

---
class: middle

Add a penalty term:

$$ \hspace{-8em} \text{Loss} = \sum\_{i=1}^{n\_\text{obs}} (u(x\_i; \theta) - u\_i )^2 $$

$$ \hspace{3em} + \lambda \; \sum\_{j=1}^{n\_\text{phys}} \Big[ f(x_j) + \nabla ( k \cdot \nabla u(x_j;\theta) ) \Big]^2 $$

A simple idea but with some interesting consequences.

If you have limited observation data $u_i$, the PDE can be used to impose additional constraint on the model $u(x;\theta)$.

This leads to more robust training and more accurate DNN models.

The model can easily incorporate data measured at irregular locations ($x$) or times ($t$).

Initial conditions and boundary conditions are less relevant.

With this method you can find approximate solutions of

$$ - \nabla ( k \cdot \nabla u ) = f $$

if you are given enough observations $u_i = u(x_i)$ even **without boundary conditions.**

This is much harder to do with a traditional scheme like finite-difference where boundary conditions are expected.

How would we solve

$$ - \nabla ( k \cdot \nabla u ) = f $$

using a convention numerical solver?

---
class: middle

In general, numerical solvers rely on a grid or a discretization of the domain using a mesh.

Take for example:

$$ - \frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} = f(x), \quad u(0) = u_0, \quad u(1) = u_1 $$

Approximate the 2nd order derivative using the finite-difference scheme:

$$ - \frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} \approx \frac{2u\_i - u\_{i+1} - u\_{i-1}}{h^2} $$

$u_i$ is an approximation of $u$ at $x_i = ih$. 

$h$ is the grid size.

---

Then, given $f_i$, solve for $u_i$

$$ \frac{2u\_i - u\_{i+1} - u\_{i-1}}{h^2} = f\_i $$

This is a linear system.

PhysML uses a different approach.

It relies on the fact the DNNs can be easily differentiated.

We will explore this idea in the next lecture video.
