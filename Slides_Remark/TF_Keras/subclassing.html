Finally, we cover custom layers and models. This is done using Python subclassing (more on this later).

This is the most general technique to build DNNs.

---
class: middle

The Sequential API and the Functional API are declarative.

A declarative programming style is one where the user expresses the _logic_ of a computation without describing its
_control flow._

Said otherwise, the user describes _what_ the object should do but not directly _how_.

---
class: middle

The subclassing method is a type of imperative programming.

That is, this is an approach where the user describes _how_ the program operates.

---
class: middle

# Imperative example.

You enter a restaurant and you say:

"I see that this table in the corner is empty. My wife and I are going to take it."

---
class: middle

# Declarative example.

You enter a restaurant and you say:

"A table for two, please."

---
class: middle

The subclassing approach uses the imperative style of programming.

imperative](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2019/01/what-are-symbolic-and-imperative-apis.html) APIs in TF.

Subclassing requires using Python inheritance.

You do not really need to know the details of this.

If you know how to use the proper syntax, it is good enough for most situations.

But let us do a little more and explain what subclassing is and how it works in Python.

---
class: middle

Inheritance is a mechanism where new classes are derived (or built on) previous classes.

The class from which a class inherits is called the parent class or **superclass.**

A class that inherits from a superclass is called a **subclass,** also called heir class or child class.

---
class: middle

In Keras, you can subclass `tf.keras.layers.Layer` and `tf.keras.Model`.

For simplicity, we will just look at subclassing `tf.keras.Model`.

---
class: middle

Here is the basic syntax:

```Python
class MyModel(keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs) # handles standard args (e.g., name)
        [...]

    def call(self, input_):
        [...]
```

---
class: middle

In `__init__()` we will set up all the data-structures (layers) that are needed by our model.

`call()` defines the sequence of computations the DNN should perform.

---
class: middle

Python uses the method `__init__` to initialize the state of a new object of that class.

This is a constructor.

It is called when a new object of that class is created.

---
class: middle

The class `MyModel` derives from the class `keras.Model`.

Derived classes in Python inherit the methods and class attributes from their parent classes.

In our case, `MyModel` inherits from `keras.Model`.

---
class: middle

Because we are subclassing, all the methods from `keras.Model` are available.

In particular, we can call the methods `compile`, `fit`, `predict`, and `evaluate` from `keras.Model`.

---
class: middle

```Python
class MyModel(keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs) # handles standard args (e.g., name)
        [...]

    def call(self, input_):
        [...]
```

---
class: middle

`super().__init__(**kwargs)` allows calling the `__init__` method of the parent class.

This ensures that the constructor of the parent class (and potentially all the relevant ancestor classes) is called.

---
class: middle

`super()` is somewhat complicated to fully explain in this lecture.

To simplify the discuss, we will say that `super()` is referring to the parent class.

---
class: middle

`super()` is closely connected to the concept of the [method resolution
order](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-method-resolution-order).

See the [`__mro__`](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=__mro__#class.__mro__) attribute.

`super()` is great to call a function defined by a parent class.

But it is most useful in cases of multiple inheritance.

---
class: middle

See this [demo Python code](https://github.com/EricDarve/cme216-spring-2020/blob/master/Code/Inheritance%20demo.ipynb) for details and examples using `super()`.

---
class: middle

For more information about `super()` see
the [super() Python doc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super)
and

class: middle

`__init__()`

```Python
def __init__(self, **kwargs):
    super().__init__(**kwargs) # handles standard args (e.g., name)
    self.hidden1 = keras.layers.Dense(4, activation="relu")
    self.hidden2 = keras.layers.Dense(4, activation="relu")
    self.hidden3 = keras.layers.Dense(4, activation="relu")
    self.out = keras.layers.Dense(1, activation="linear")
```

---
class: middle

As we explained above, we first call `super().__init__()` so that the parent classes are initialized.

Then we build the three hidden layers and the output `self.out`.

---
class: middle

Note how, although we are defining 3 hidden layers and 1 output layer, we are not specifying how they are going to be
used.

This will be done in `call()`.

---
class: middle

Compared to the previous case, we changed the activation function to `relu`.

---
class: middle

`call()`

```Python
def call(self, input_):
    hidden1 = self.hidden1(input_)
    hidden2 = self.hidden2(hidden1)
    hidden3 = self.hidden3(hidden2)
    concat = layers.Concatenate()([input_, hidden3])
    return self.out(concat)
```

---
class: middle

`call` then defines the actual sequence of calculation to perform.

`self.hidden1(input_)` uses

`keras.layers.Dense(4, activation="relu")`

to calculate numerical values that are stored in `hidden1`.

---
class: middle

`concat` does not need to be part of the class since it is computed from `input_` and `hidden3`.

---
class: middle

We note that since we only define the layers and the sequence of operations, we have left a few things undefined.

For example, the size of `input_` is not defined yet.

The shape of the input is defined later when calling `fit`.

---
class: middle

The rest of the code is the same as what we had before.

```Python
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=sgd, metrics=['mse','mae'])
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=n_epochs,
                    validation_data=(X_valid, y_valid))
```

---
class: middle

The `relu` activation is doing a little worse in this case.

---
class: middle

Finally, we show a different example where we use a different input.

The first observation is that the function is even.

So we could use as input $x^2$.

---
class: middle

But we can use more inputs as well.

Let's try

$$(2 x^2 - 1, 8 x^4 - 8 x^2 + 1)$$

These are the first even Chebyshev polynomials of order 2 and 4.

---
class: middle

Let us compare all these models.

---

---
class: middle

`relu` has the worst performance.

`multi X` is relatively more efficient as it exhibits an error similar to `seq DNN` but uses half of the training data.

---
class: middle

Note how difficult it is to train these models to get high accuracy.

The convergence is rather slow.
