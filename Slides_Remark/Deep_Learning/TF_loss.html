Let us review the loss functions that are available in TensorFlow.

---
class: middle

See [Keras loss documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/losses) for the complete list.

---
class: middle

`BinaryCrossentropy`

Cross entropy when only two labels (0 and 1) are possible.

---
class: middle

`CategoricalCrossentropy`

Cross entropy with more than 2 labels.

This is the case we explained.

---
class: middle

`Hinge`

This is a variant which applies when the labels are either -1 or 1.

The formula is

loss = $\max(1 - y\_\text{true} \; y\_\text{pred}, 0)$

where $y\_\text{true}$ and $y\_\text{pred}$ are the labels.

---
class: middle

`CategoricalHinge`

This is the hinge loss for the case where more than 2 labels are possible.

---
class: middle

The formula is

loss = $\max(1 - \text{pos} + \text{neg}, 0)$

where:</br>
pos = $\sum\_i [y\_\text{true}]\_i \; [y\_\text{pred}]\_i$</br>
neg = $\max\_i ((1-[y\_\text{true}]\_i) [y\_\text{pred}]\_i)$

---
class: middle

This applies when $y$ is a probability.

---
class: middle

Let's assume that $y\_\text{true}$ is a one-hot vector.

---
class: middle

Then

pos = $\sum\_i [y\_\text{true}]\_i \; [y\_\text{pred}]\_i = [y\_\text{pred}]\_t$

is the value of $y\_\text{pred}$ for the true label $t$.

---
class: middle

neg = $\max\_{i \neq t} [y\_\text{pred}]\_i$

is the maximum of $y\_\text{pred}$ for all labels different from the true one $t$.

---
class: middle

So, using compact notations

loss = $\max ( 1 - [y\_\text{pred}]\_t + \max\_i [y\_\text{pred}]\_{i \neq t}, 0 )$

---
class: middle

For a good model:

$[y\_\text{pred}]\_t \approx 1$

$\max\_i [y\_\text{pred}]\_{i \neq t} \ll 1$

So the loss will be small.

class: middle

Note that the [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/losses/CategoricalHinge) for
CategoricalHinge has a rather mistifying error.

Can you find it?

---
class: middle

The formula for `neg` and `pos` is not correct for some reason.

Fortunately, the
[code](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/b3c65cd1820d598e8b5f399b4f542f6d24712023/tensorflow/python/keras/losses.py#L856)
is correct.
